	            <center><p>Hello! My name is Justin Clyde Sta. Maria, the author of this page. I am 19 years old and I am a third year college student taking up Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education, major in Information and Communication Technology at the Technological University of the Philippines - Cavite. I spend most of my time playing games and watching game related stuff on multiple video platforms such as YouTube. I've been so fond of games ever since I was little and nothing makes me more proud than beating a specific level or finishing a game that I spend a lot of time on. This website is an opportunity for me to share my knowledge and passion for games. You see, playing a game is especially fun when others are playing it too, that way, you will be able to talk about it, compete and discuss with your peers. Here at WASD GAMERS, I want everyone to discover games that they haven't heard about or games that I like to share with them. Games aren't just for entertainment or to kill time. Games can also bring people together, bring out the competitive side within them and discover a wonderful world that they have never seen before. Well, that is all for me! I hope you enjoy your stay here at WASD GAMERS!</p><br>
